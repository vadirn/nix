## Minimize what the reader holds in memory

Repeat past information where needed instead of forcing the reader to remember it. Do the math for them. Use obvious examples.

| Before                                                   | After                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As mentioned in Section 2, the token limit applies here. | The token limit (4096 tokens) applies here.                                 |
| Token A costs 0.003 per unit. With 1000 units...         | Each token costs $0.003. For 1000 tokens, that's $3.00.                     |
| The function described earlier handles this case.        | The `validate()` function (which checks required fields) handles this case. |

**Principle:** summarize prerequisites inline rather than linking out. Context switches cost the reader's attention.
