## One idea per sentence

If a sentence has more than one idea, split it. Target 15–25 words per sentence. Short sentences are easier to read, understand, and remember.

### After splitting, reconnect

Splitting can produce fragments that sit next to each other without showing how they relate. The reader sees facts but not the flow.

After splitting a long sentence, reconnect the pieces. Show the relationship between adjacent sentences.

**Reconnection techniques:**

- **Conjunction** — "and", "so", "but", "because", "however" merge two short sentences into one
- **Shared subject** — carry "it" or "the system" forward instead of starting fresh
- **Reference back** — "the result is", "on top of that", "this" ties to the previous sentence
- **Clause merge** — make one sentence a clause of the other ("a tracker with X and Y" instead of "a tracker. X. Y.")

**Vary the technique.** Too many conjunctions of the same kind create their own rhythm problem.

**Diagnostic:** read two adjacent sentences. If they describe the same thing but feel unrelated, reconnect them.
