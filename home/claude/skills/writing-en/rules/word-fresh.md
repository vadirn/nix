## Invent fresh comparisons

When you need a figure of speech, create one that produces a visual image. Dead metaphors ("level playing field", "at the end of the day") are invisible to the reader.

| Before                | After                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| think outside the box | (say what you actually mean)  |
| a level playing field | equal starting conditions     |
| move the needle       | increase signups by 10%       |
| low-hanging fruit     | tasks that take under an hour |

**Orwell's procedure:** think wordlessly first, visualize the thing, then hunt for words that fit. Only after that, switch perspective and check what impression the words make on someone else.
