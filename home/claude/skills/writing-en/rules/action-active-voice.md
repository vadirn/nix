## Use active voice

Active voice shows who does what. Make the actor the subject and the action the verb. Reserve passive for cases where the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

| Before                                | After                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| New regulations were proposed.        | We proposed new regulations.   |
| The lake was polluted by the company. | The company polluted the lake. |
| The feature was shipped.              | The team shipped the feature.  |

**Exception:** passive is fine when the actor is unknown or unimportant: "The server was rebooted at 3 AM."
