## Use informative headings

Make headers meaningful on their own. If someone only reads the headings, they should understand the document's structure and main points.

| Before       | After                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Introduction | Why We Recommend Migration |
| Background   | Current System Limitations |
| Discussion   | Three Migration Options    |
| Conclusion   | Timeline and Next Steps    |

**Test:** read only the headings. Can you understand the document without the body text?
