## Get to the main verb within 7 words

Keep the subject short and place it early. Long openings before the main verb force the reader to hold too much in memory.

| Before                                                                              | After                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The evaluation of the program by the committee resulted in a recommendation.        | The committee evaluated the program and recommended changes. |
| A number of issues that were raised during the review process need to be addressed. | The review raised several issues. We need to address them.   |

**Diagnostic:** count words before the main verb. More than 7? Move the subject closer to the front and shorten it.
