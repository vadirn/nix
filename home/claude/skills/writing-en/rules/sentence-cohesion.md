## After splitting, reconnect

"One idea per sentence" tells you to split. But splitting can produce fragments that sit next to each other without showing how they relate. The reader sees facts but not the flow.

After splitting a long sentence, reconnect the pieces. Show the relationship between adjacent sentences.

**Reconnection techniques:**

- **Conjunction** — "and", "so", "but" merge two short sentences into one
- **Shared subject** — carry "it" or "the system" forward instead of starting fresh
- **Reference back** — "the result is", "on top of that", "this" ties to the previous sentence
- **Clause merge** — make one sentence a clause of the other ("a tracker with X and Y" instead of "a tracker. X. Y.")
- **Dash or semicolon** — link two closely related statements without a conjunction

**Vary the technique.** Too many dashes create their own rhythm problem.

**Diagnostic:** read two adjacent sentences. If they describe the same thing but feel unrelated, reconnect them.
