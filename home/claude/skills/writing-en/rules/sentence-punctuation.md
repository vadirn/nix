## Match punctuation to emphasis

Colon, dash, and parentheses interrupt a sentence at three levels of emphasis. Pick the one that matches the weight of the interruption.

**Emphasis scale:**

- **Colon** — formal announcement: "here is what I mean"
- **Dash** — casual or dramatic aside
- **Parentheses** — minimized aside, feels unimportant

**When the aside has internal commas, use dashes** instead of commas to avoid ambiguity.

**Semicolons** link two closely related sentences when the first is short (under ~15 words). If you need a semicolon because the sentence is long, split it with a period instead.
