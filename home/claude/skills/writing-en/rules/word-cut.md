## Cut every word you can

Read each sentence and remove words that add no meaning. If the sentence works without a word, the word was dead weight.

| Before                                         | After             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| It is important to note that the system fails. | The system fails. |
| due to the fact that                           | because           |
| in the event that                              | if                |
| each and every                                 | every             |
| full and complete                              | complete          |

**Categories to cut:** meaningless words ("kind of", "actually", "basically"), doubled words ("full and complete"), inferable words ("anticipate in advance" → "anticipate"), phrases replaceable by a single word ("due to the fact that" → "because").
