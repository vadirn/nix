## Express actions as verbs

Find the real action hidden in a nominalization and turn it back into a verb. Nominalizations (-tion, -ment, -ance) bury the action and bloat the sentence.

**Diagnostic (Williams):** look at the first 7–8 words. If you find abstract nouns where verbs should be and no specific agent — revise.
