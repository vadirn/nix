## One topic per paragraph

Each paragraph develops one idea. Start with a topic sentence, add details, examples, or evidence. When you shift to a new idea, start a new paragraph.

| Before                                                            | After                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A single paragraph covering architecture, testing, and deployment | Three paragraphs: architecture, testing, deployment      |
| A 15-sentence paragraph about everything                          | Three paragraphs of 3–5 sentences, each about one aspect |

**Structure:** topic sentence → supporting details → (optional) transition to next paragraph.
