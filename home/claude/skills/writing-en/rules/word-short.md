## Choose the shortest word that carries your meaning

Short words are faster to read and harder to misunderstand. When a short word carries the same meaning as a long one, use the short one.

| Before        | After |
| ------------- | ----- |
| utilize       | use   |
| facilitate    | help  |
| approximately | about |
| commence      | start |
| subsequently  | then  |
