## Use everyday English

Prefer familiar words your audience already knows. Save technical terms for when no everyday equivalent exists.

| Before     | After      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| utilize    | use        |
| terminate  | end        |
| sufficient | enough     |
| prior to   | before     |
| endeavor   | try        |
| in lieu of | instead of |

**Edge case:** when writing for specialists, use their standard terms. "Idempotent" is clearer than "safe to repeat" for a developer audience.
