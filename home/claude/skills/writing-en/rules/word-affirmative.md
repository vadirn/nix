## Use affirmative form

Negatives force the reader to picture an action and then cancel it. Affirmatives give the right picture immediately.

| Before           | After             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| not different    | similar           |
| not many         | few               |
| did not remember | forgot            |
| not able to      | unable to / can't |
| not possible     | impossible        |

**Double negatives:** "not uncommon" → "common". "not impossible" → "possible".
