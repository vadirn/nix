## Vary sentence length and structure

AI text is predictable: medium-length sentences, every paragraph opens with a generalization, excessive "balance" ("on one hand... on the other"). Break the pattern.

| Before                                                                                       | After                                                                                                   |

| Every sentence is 15–20 words. Every sentence is 15–20 words. Every sentence is 15–20 words. | Mix lengths. Some sentences are short. Others stretch out to carry a more complex idea across the line. |
| On one hand X, on the other hand Y. (when the answer is clear)                               | X.                                                                                                      |
| Furthermore... Additionally... Moreover...                                                   | (remove the connectives if the logic already flows)                                                     |

**Techniques:** follow a long explanation with a short sentence. Start one paragraph with a question, another with a fact, another with an example.
